#ifndef UHPA_H
#define UHPA_H

/* "Union of heap pointer and array"
 *
 * This set of macros is intended to provide a simple means of treating a
 * variable as a heap pointer or a fixed size array, depending on the size of
 * the data being stored. It was borne out of the situation where the majority
 * of calls to malloc for a struct member were ending up less than 8 bytes -
 * i.e. the size of the 64-bit pointer. By using uhpa a great number of calls
 * to malloc could be avoided. The downsize to this method is that you must
 * always know the length of data that you are dealing with.
 *
 * The data structure you provide must look something like:
 *
 * typedef union {
 *		void *ptr;
 *		char array[MAX_ARRAY_SIZE];
 *	} uhpa_u
 *
 * This code really only makes sense if the data types you want to store are
 * smaller than a pointer - the most obvious choice being bytes. All of these
 * functions assume that the array is made up of single bytes.
 *
 * You can change the type of ptr to match your needs, with the above caveat
 * about array. So make ptr a char*, uint8_t*, unsigned char*, ...
 *
 * It should be possible to modify the code to work with arrays that have
 * element sizes bigger than a byte.
 *
 * Define MAX_ARRAY_SIZE to be as large as you want, depending on the size of
 * your commonly used data. Define MAX_ARRAY_SIZE to be sizeof(void *) if you
 * do not want to "waste" any memory per item - with the tradeoff that calls to
 * malloc will be more frequent because MAX_ARRAY_SIZE will only be 4 or 8
 * bytes, depending on your architecture.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * Basic Functions
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Note that if you are using strings, set size to be strlen(s)+1, so that the
 * null terminator is included, or use the _STR functions below.
 *
 * UHPA_ALLOC(u, size)
 *		Call to allocate memory to a uhpa variable if required.
 *
 *		u : the uhpa data type that will have memory allocated or not,
 *		depending on "size".
 *		size : the length of the data to be stored, in bytes.
 *
 *		returns :	1 if memory was allocated successfully
 *					0 if memory was not able to be allocated
 *					-1 if no memory needed to be allocated
 * 
 * UHPA_ACCESS(u, size)
 *		Call to access (for read or write) a uhpa variable that has already had
 *		UHPA_ALLOC() called on it.
 *
 *		u : the uhpa data type that has already had memory allocated.
 *		size : the length of the stored data, in bytes.
 *
 *		returns : an appropriate pointer/array address
 *
 * UHPA_FREE(u, size)
 *		Call to free memory associated with a uhpa variable. This is safe to
 *		call with a data structure that does not have heap allocated memory.
 *
 *		u : the uhpa data type that has already had memory allocated.
 *		size : the length of the stored data, in bytes.
 *		
 * UHPA_MOVE(dest, src, src_size)
 *		Call to move memory stored in one uhpa variable to another. If the data
 *		is stored with heap allocated memory, then dest.ptr is set to src.ptr.
 *		If the data is stored as an array, memmove is used to copy data from
 *		src to dest. In both cases the data stored in src is invalidated by
 *		setting src.ptr to NULL and calling memset(src.array, 0, src_size)
 *		respectively.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * String Functions
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Convenience functions when working with strings. These are identical to the
 * non-string versions, except that they increase the value of "size" by 1, to
 * take into account the need for storing the 0 termination character.
 *
 * UHPA_ALLOC_STR(u, size)
 * UHPA_ACCESS_STR(u, size)
 * UHPA_FREE_STR(u, size)
 * UHPA_MOVE_STR(dest, src, size)
 *		
 * =============================================================================
 * Forcing use of malloc
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * If you wish to force the use of malloc without removing the UHPA macros from
 * your code (i.e. the macros will never use the array part of the union) then
 * #define UHPA_FORCE_MALLOC before including this file.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * Memory Functions
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * If you wish to use your own memory functions for alloc/free, #define both
 * uhpa_malloc and uhpa_free to your own functions.
